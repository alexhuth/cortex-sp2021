# Cortex Infographic

Assignments for this class revolve around creating an **infographic** illustrating the **anatomy** and **function** of human cortex.

Your infographic will take the form of a **cortical flatmap**, an image that is shaped just right so that it can be wrapped around a 3D model of a real human cortex.

### Getting started

1. Download one of the blank images from this directory (either `blank.png` or `blank+curv.png` — the latter includes shading for cortical curvature, which make it easier to find some anatomical features).
2. Open the blank image in your favorite image editing software (e.g. Photoshop, Illustrator, Inkscape).
3. Draw some things!
4. Save your edited image as a new file, e.g. `my_infographic.png`. 
5. Open the [3D infographic viewer](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huth/infographic_viewer/) in your web browser.
6. After the brain has finished loading, click the **"Choose File"** button (top left) and select your new image file.
7. Check out how it looks!

You can also watch [this short video demo](https://utexas.box.com/shared/static/10phy17792s0bfp9v6l6igqwb328d6mo.mp4) showing how the basic process of creating these infographics works.

### Editing your infographic
You can edit your infographic image in any image editing or illustration software, as long as the result can be saved in a standard image format like PNG. Good software you might use includes [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (free!), Adobe Photoshop (not free), and Adobe Illustrator (not free).

You are free to use any combination of styles/colors/lines/etc. that you desire.

The image that you upload to the viewer MUST be a common file format like PNG. You cannot, for example, upload a photoshop PSD file. To get a PNG file out of your image editing software, you might need to use a command like "Export" or "Save as..". Try to be sure that your new image has the same dimensions as the original — 2105 pixels wide by 1024 pixels tall!

### Using the 3D viewer
To start the 3D viewer, [click on this link](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huth/infographic_viewer/).

To upload your infographic in the 3D viewer, click the **Choose File** button in the top left and select your saved infographic.

To see the keyboard shortcuts available within the viewer, press the "h" key once the viewer has finished loading.

To navigate within the 3D viewer, you can:
* click and drag your mouse/trackpad to rotate the brain,
* right-click (or equivalent) and drag your mouse/trackpad to zoom,
* press the "i" key on your keyboard to show the "inflated" brain,
* press the "f" key on your keyboard to show the "flattened" brain (this will look just like your image file),
* press the "r" key on your keyboard to reset to the original view,
* click the "Open Controls" button in the top right to expand a detailed set of controls.

## Homework 1: Anatomy
For the first homework, you will need to draw and label several major anatomical features, including **major sulci**, the cortical **lobes**, and the cortical **poles**. You need to label every feature in both the left and the right hemispheres. 

The total possible score on this assignment is **78 points**. Bonus points will be awarded for particularly artistic or creative results. 

For reference on how to find these anatomical features, please see the [gross anatomy lecture slides](../lecture_slides/02-gross-neuroanatomy.pdf), the [online anatomical viewer](https://gallantlab.org/brainviewer/sulcigyri/), and any other resources you might find on the wider internet.

When you're done with your infographic, please upload your image (after testing it on the 3D viewer) to Canvas.

#### Major sulci
Your first task is to draw the major sulci (6 points each = 36 points), including:

* Sylvian fissure / lateral sulcus (easy)
* Central suclus (easy)
* Parietooccipital sulcus (~easy)
* Superior temporal sulcus (~easy)
* Calcarine sulcus (~tricky)
* Intraparietal sulcus (tricky)

For each sulcus you should draw a line that approximately follows the very bottom (or "*fundus*") of the sulcus, and then add a text label saying which sulcus it is. If the sulcus is branched or otherwise complicated, you can add several lines (or come up with your own way to show that). 

Note that the calcarine sulcus falls exactly along one of the "cuts" used to create the flatmap that you are drawing on, and thus will show up along one of the edges.

#### Lobes
Your second task is to annotate the cortical lobes (6 points each = 24 points):

* Frontal lobe
* Temporal lobe
* Parietal lobe
* Occipital lobe

You can decide how best to annotate each lobe.

#### Poles
Your third and final task is to annotate the cortical poles (6 points each = 18 points), including:

* the frontal pole
* the temporal pole
* the occipital pole

You can decide how best to annotate each pole.

## Homework 2: Visual Cortex
For the second homework, you will need to annotate several features of visual cortex. You need to annotate every feature in **both the left and the right hemispheres**.

The total possible score on this assignment is **75 points**.

**IMPORTANT:** You should add these new annotations _on top of your infographic from Homework 1_. Try to make it so that both old and new annotations are legible/visible, but the most important thing here is the new visual cortex annotations.

When you're done with your updated infographic, please upload your image (after testing it on the 3D viewer) to Canvas.

#### Retinotopic visual cortex
Your first task is to annotate the major retinotopic visual areas (10 points each = 30 points):

* Primary visual cortex (V1)
* V2
* V3

For each area, you should draw an outline (this does not need to be perfectly accurate, you are guessing here, after all!), and use coloring, shading, or labels to indicate which parts of each area are selective for:

* Foveal vs. peripheral visual field (i.e. eccentricity)
* Dorsal vs. ventral visual field
* Left vs. right visual field

#### Category-selective visual cortex
Your second task is to annotate the major category-selective visual areas (5 points each = 45 points), including:

* Face-selective areas
  * Fusiform face area (FFA)
  * Occipital face area (OFA)
  * Superior temporal sulcus face area (STS-FA)
* Place-selective areas
  * Parahippocampal place area (PPA)
  * Occipital place area (OPA)
  * Retrosplenial complex (RSC)
* Body-selective areas
  * Extrastriate body area (EBA)
  * Fusiform body area (FBA)
* Pokemon-selective areas

For each area, you should draw or shade the area itself, include a label with the area name, and use some method (legend, inset cartoon, etc.) to indicate the selectivity of each area.
